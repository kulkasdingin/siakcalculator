# siakcalculator

Sometimes you need to calculate your own partially final score on a course to know the exact final score (since the lecturer forgot to publish it or something). 

Instead of calculating it one by one via calculator, just copy and paste your score to this siakcalculator and voila you get your final score.

Disclaimer: Don't worry, the magic happens on your side. No data is sent before/during/after the calculation
